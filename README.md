### Introduction
The major objective of this project is to implement a Kalman filter using *C++* as primay tool and tests with the [`Udacity simulator`](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). I'll be discussing following details to undestand few theoritical concepts that are used to implement this project.

* Sensors ex: Redar and Liadar
* Kalman filter
* Extended Kalman filter
* Sensor fusion
